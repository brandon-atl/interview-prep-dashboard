# Changelog - Google Play Interview Prep Dashboard

## Session: September 17, 2025

### Fixes
- Corrected the question filter handler so search and interviewer inputs no longer overwrite the category selector with `[object Event]`, restoring reliable filtering across all controls.
- Added defensive guards around question toggles and story details so missing DOM nodes or invalid indices no longer throw runtime errors during interaction.
- Normalized STAR story metadata to honor both `fromDocument`/`fromDocuments`, restoring the "From Documents" badge for sample stories.
- Rewired the sample data loader to call the existing question/story renderers instead of undefined helpers, preventing crashes when injecting the Google interview presets.
- Hardened panelist parsing so failed JD extractions now fall back to Q&A and notes heuristics, keeping the Panel Strategy tab populated.

### Enhancements
- Added an optional Gemini API key form (with session-only storage) and forwarded the key via secure headers so users can enable LLM assists without redeploying the backend.
- Potential Gaps to Address now derives from JD‚áÑresume comparisons and the Get Strategies action generates tailored mitigation plans instead of static tips.
- The optional Gemini API key form now lives directly below the upload controls so users can enable assists before processing files.
- Company intelligence now prioritizes "Intelligence" source files, enriches summaries via Gemini when a key is provided, and folds in resume-derived background plus strategic-doc strengths/gaps.

### Major Changes

#### üéØ End‚Äëto‚ÄëEnd Dynamic Extraction (No Hardcoding)
- Removed remaining hardcoded examples in STAR Stories and company/role logic; all content now derives from uploaded materials.
- Header title now displays a cleaned company name from the JD/resume (cuts parentheses/acronyms, stops at sentence starts, dedupes, clamps length).

#### ü§ñ Optional LLM Assist (Gemini)
- Added a secure, serverless LLM proxy (`api/llm.js`) that supports tasks: `panelists`, `star`, `culture`, `companyRole`, `metrics`, `strengths`, `questions`.
- Client hooks (`llmExtract`) merge LLM results only when helpful, with strict fallbacks to deterministic parsers.
- Feature is opt‚Äëin by default and never exposes a key to the browser (reads `GEMINI_API_KEY` on the server; temporary local fallback key provided and intended for rotation).

#### üë• Panelists Extraction (JD‚ÄëFirst, Robust)
- Rewrote JD parsing to handle PDF quirks:
  - LinkedIn‚Äëanchored scan pairs each profile URL with the nearest preceding ‚ÄúName, Role‚Äù line.
  - Bullet/inline parser scopes to the ‚ÄúInterviewing With‚Äù section; accepts ‚ÄúName, Role (link)‚Äù and name/role on adjacent lines.
  - Keeps panelists even when role text is missing/garbled (no silent drops).
- Added a rescue pass that always runs after JD + LLM to catch link‚Äëonly lines.
- Normalized role‚Üíarchetype mapping (Champion/Ally/Gatekeeper/Technical Expert) with stronger, company‚Äëagnostic rules.
- Removed the previous cap of 3 panelists; renders any number present (1+).
- Added a debug mode (`?debug=1`) that shows a breakdown (LinkedIn‚Äëanchored/Bullets/Fallback/LLM/Rescued/Final) above the panelist grid.

#### ‚≠ê STAR Stories (From Materials Only)
- Replaced embedded samples with a generic S/T/A/R extractor that reads labeled blocks (Situation/Task/Action/Result or S/T/A/R) from uploaded text.
- If few/no stories are found, optionally calls the LLM to summarize additional S/T/A/R items from your materials; deduped and capped.

#### üß† Cultural Fit (Context‚ÄëDependent)
- ‚ÄúGenerate Analysis‚Äù builds work mode, values, signals, benefits, and panelist context from uploaded content.
- When enabled, LLM provides a structured cultural summary; otherwise, heuristics use the JD/resume content.

#### üßπ Company/Role & Metrics/Strengths/Q&A
- Company and role: improved cleaners (stop at verbs, strip parentheses/acronyms, dedupe tokens, clamp words).
- Metrics/Strengths/Questions: deterministic extractors supplemented by LLM only when needed; merge safely without duplicates.

### UI/UX & Styling
- Unified gradient across header and body; uses `background-attachment: fixed` for a continuous look.
- Added ‚ÄúUse Test Files‚Äù button and a test manifest for fast local validation.

### Files Added/Updated
- `api/llm.js` ‚Äì Vercel serverless function for Gemini proxy.
- `assets/js/app.js` ‚Äì Major refactor: JD parsers, LLM hooks, STAR/culture/company/metrics/strengths/Q&A extraction, archetype mapping, debug tools.
- `assets/css/styles.css` ‚Äì Unified gradient for body/header.
- `index.html` ‚Äì ‚ÄúUse Test Files‚Äù action; debug compatible.
- `input_files_test/manifest.json` ‚Äì Test manifest used by the one‚Äëclick loader.

### Usage Notes
- To enable debug view of panelist extraction, open with `?debug=1`.
- LLM is optional; set `GEMINI_API_KEY` in Vercel for production. The dashboard still works without it using deterministic parsers.

### Major Changes

#### üö´ Upload-First, Agnostic Dashboard
- Removed all auto-loading and hardcoded/sampled data paths
- Disabled all tabs until files are processed; Upload is the landing tab
- Hid Interview Countdown until a JD file (filename contains "JD") with an `Interview Date:` is parsed
- Replaced remaining static copy with placeholders; content is now derived only from uploaded files

#### üß≠ Command Center Now Data-Driven
- Metrics tiles: render only from uploaded metrics (CSV or extracted) with strict validation (currency/percent/M,B,K)
- Removed CSV-from-text mis-parsing; CSV parsing occurs only for explicit metrics CSV uploads
- Nonsense tiles eliminated; long labels/growth/context are truncated for clean UI
- Added Copy Metrics button (Markdown)

#### üß† Company Intel (Agnostic)
- Added `extractCompanyIntelAgnostic()` to build a Markdown briefing from uploaded content:
  - Detected tech stack, key metrics, strengths, and gaps
- Render briefing as Markdown; added tech stack badges above briefing
- Copy/Download briefing actions (Markdown)

#### üìÑ Resume Integration
- Text extraction from uploaded resume files (filename contains "resume")
- Merged resume-derived strengths into Command Center strengths
- Role inference from resume when not available elsewhere (prefers recent dated title lines)
- PDF resumes supported via PDF.js; DOCX via Mammoth

#### üß© SQL-Only Experience, With Helpers
- SQL tab shows only if SQL is detected in uploads
- Parsed ```sql fenced blocks and inline SELECT/WITH queries; best snippet auto-loads into editor
- Snippet picker with file filter, source note, and Copy button
- Dynamic schema (tables from SQL) and scenarios derived from document signals (retention, segmentation, optimization, pipelines)
- Enriched SQL Context card: fills scale, volume, key challenge, tech stack, focus areas, and interviewers from data

#### ‚úçÔ∏è Power Intro & Talking Points
- Power Intro generator is now agnostic and built from your metrics, strengths, and tech stack
- Talking Points generator derives Technical Relevance, Proof Points, and Strengths from uploaded content

#### üîñ Quick Tips
- Tips generated from strengths, gaps, and tech stack; Generate Tips button added

#### üì¶ Snapshot Export
- Export Snapshot (Markdown) and Copy Snapshot actions include: tech stack, metrics, strengths, gaps, panelists, top Q&A, SQL snippet list, and the executive brief

### Technical Notes
- Added resume-based helpers: role inference and strength extraction from uploaded resume files
- Added PDF parsing to `readFileContent()` to support PDF uploads across the app
- Added UI gating (`requires-data`) and disabled classes for tabs before processing
- Added source notes/tooltips for metrics and SQL snippet sources

### Files Updated (highlights)
- `index.html`: upload-first UI, requires-data gating, toolbars (copy/export), tech badges, SQL picker filter
- `assets/js/app.js`: upload-only logic, metrics sanitation, dynamic intel/contexts, SQL detection & picker, export/copy helpers, resume parsing & role inference, PDF parsing
- `assets/css/styles.css`: disabled state for tabs/buttons

### Migration/Usage
- Start on Upload tab, add your files (JD, resume, Q&A, metrics CSV, intel/playbook)
- Click Process Files ‚Äî all tabs and content will derive from your materials
- Use Copy/Export to share metrics/brief/snapshot; SQL features activate only when SQL is detected
