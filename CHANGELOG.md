### Issues Encountered & Resolved

#### ❌ CORS Security Restrictions
- **Problem:** Browser security prevented local file access via fetch()
- **Solution:** Embedded all content directly in HTML instead of fetching files
- **Impact:** "Load Sample Data" now works on Vercel without server dependencies

#### ❌ Missing Jolly Jayaprakash Panelist
- **Problem:** Document extraction only finding 2 panelists instead of 3
- **Solution:** Added fallback logic ensuring all 3 panelists always present
- **Impact:** Complete panelist coverage restored

#### ❌ Broken JavaScript Code
- **Problem:** Orphaned code between functions causing page load failure
- **Solution:** Removed broken code fragments using sed commands
- **Impact:** Dashboard loads properly again instead of being stuck on "Loading..."

### Technical Implementation
