**Your Approach**:

"Based on my Trulieve segmentation improving retention 12%, I'd tackle Play Points progression through:

**Week 1-2: Diagnostic Analysis**
```sql
WITH progression_analysis AS (
  SELECT 
    member_id,
    tier_level,
    PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY daily_points) as median_velocity,
    DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), last_activity, DAY) as days_inactive,
    points_to_next_tier / NULLIF(avg_daily_points, 0) as days_to_promotion
  FROM member_activity
  WHERE tier_level = 'Gold'
)
```

**Week 3-4: Intervention Design**
- Identify members 70-85% toward Platinum
- Create personalized bonus events
- A/B test threshold adjustments

**Month 2-6: Implementation & Monitoring**
- Deploy targeted campaigns via BigQuery ML predictions
- Weekly cohort performance tracking
- Iterate based on engagement metrics

**Expected Impact**: 
- 20% increase in Platinum members (44,000 additional)

    LEAD(tier_level) OVER w as next_tier
  FROM `google-play.loyalty.transactions`
  WHERE DATE(transaction_date) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 90 DAY)
  WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY member_id ORDER BY transaction_date)
)
SELECT 
  tier_level,
  COUNT(DISTINCT member_id) as member_count,
  APPROX_QUANTILES(total_points, 100)[OFFSET(50)] as median_points
